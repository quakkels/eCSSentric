# MinimaCSS

MinimaCSS is not intended to be treated as a library or framework.
It's a skeleton of styles designed to provide a starting point where 
basic decisions have already been made, but anything can be customized.

Rather than starting from scratch, MinimaCSS provides default styles 
with customizable variables (located in [minima.config.css]()) to get 
your design up and running quickly, to start getting design feedback
as fast as possible.

## Getting Started

Duplicate the repo and start changing anything you want.

MinimaCSS uses `rem` size values. Given the default values in 
[minima.reset.css](), `1.6rem` will be equivalent to `16px`.

## Configuration

- `--gutter` Used to set the gap between layout boxes.

## Todo

- [ ] grid/masonry styles and demo (multi column example)
- [ ] flex styles supporting multi 'columns'
- [ ] refine configuration variable names for clarity
- [ ] document configuration values
- [ ] dynamic call-to-action button styles and demo
- [ ] mobile styles using media queries and/or contaienr queries
